# Python
MatrixExcelManipulations.
Matrix to be stored in form of 8*56 in an excel sheet.
I have used pandas to read the excel sheet with openpyxl as write engine.
Heatmap is via matplotlib.pyplot

Heatmap generated is then seggregated and fed into tensorflow based convolutional neural network for pattern recognition.
